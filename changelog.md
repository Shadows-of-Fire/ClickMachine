## 6.0.5
* Follow-up fix to a bug added in 6.0.4, the ray-trace now properly uses the eye position instead of the feet position.
* When the click machine is using items with extra reach distance, the range of the machine will increase accordingly.

## 6.0.4
* Fixed startup crash from registry issues.
* Fixed Click Machine being unable to use buckets.
  * This is done by changing the position of the fake player to be 2 blocks lower, so the eye pos is where the "click" happens from.

## 6.0.3
* Rebuilt for 1.18.2

## 6.0.2
* Updated to Placebo 6.1.0
* Fixed a dupe bug.

## 6.0.0
* Updated to 1.18.1

## 5.0.0

## 4.5.0
* Added a dummy rainbow power bar when power is disabled, to hopefully make people realize power is disabled.

## 4.4.1
* Made it so the Click Machine fake player cannot be teleported, which crashes normally.

## 4.4.0
* Click Machine has received a brand new GUI! - https://i.imgur.com/7OeVssp.png
